Introduction:
Cancer remains one of the most challenging medical conditions, affecting millions worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improving survival rates. However, traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes invasive. With the advancement in data science and machine learning, there's an opportunity to revolutionize how cancer is diagnosed.

Problem Statement:
This project, "Advanced Cancer Diagnosis Assistant," aims to harness the power of machine learning to create a predictive model that accurately classifies tumors as benign or malignant. Utilizing a dataset comprising various cellular attributes from breast cancer samples, the project will explore, analyze, and model the data to assist in cancer diagnosis. The ultimate goal is to develop a tool that aids medical professionals in making faster, more accurate diagnoses and opens new avenues in the understanding of cancerous cell behaviors.

Objectives:

Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis to uncover insights from cancer cell attributes.
Develop and evaluate several machine learning models for accurate tumor classification.
Create an easy-to-use interface for medical professionals to input data and receive diagnostic predictions.
Contribute to the field of medical data science through innovative approaches in cancer diagnosis.
